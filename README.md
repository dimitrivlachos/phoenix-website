# Official Phoenix Website

This is a website I built for a small business in my area. It is a single page application built with Vue.js and Tailwind CSS.

It is meant to be a simple and informative website that is easy to navigate and provides all the necessary information about the business.

The development site can be found at: [https://dimitrivlachos.github.io/phoenix-website/](https://dimitrivlachos.github.io/phoenix-website/)
